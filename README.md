# Individual Project

This repository/assignment is a starting point for your semester-long, individual language implementation project.
Over the course of the semester, we will introduce various milestones prompting you to add to your implementation.
You should complete all of your work in this repository, using good `git` practices throughout development, _e.g._, commiting and pushing changes periodically.
If you need help with using Git, check out this [Mini-course/repository on using Git and Github](https://github.com/csc312-grinnell/github-starter-course).
